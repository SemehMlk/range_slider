Subject: RE: Request for New Project Creation – Rule Grammar

Dear [Software Factory Support],

Thank you for your response.

Would it be possible to proceed with the project creation first, without assigning me as the owner? Once the project is created, I will submit the necessary GRANT request for the group owner profile.

We need this project as soon as possible, so your prompt support would be highly appreciated.

Please let me know if this can be arranged.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
