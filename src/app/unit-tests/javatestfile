API for Validation and Conversion of MX and MT Messages

Overview: This API, developed within the Flex project, is designed to handle the validation and conversion of financial messages in MX and MT formats. It serves as a critical component for ensuring the integrity and proper formatting of these messages before they are processed further.

Main Features:

1. Message Validation:

Supports validation of both MX (ISO 20022 XML) and MT (SWIFT FIN) message formats.

Ensures that messages comply with industry standards and specific business rules.

Returns detailed validation reports indicating any issues found within the message structure or content.



2. Message Conversion:

Provides conversion capabilities between MX and MT formats.

Allows seamless transformation of messages from one format to another, ensuring compatibility with different systems and workflows.



3. Message Parsing:

Extracts relevant data fields from both MX and MT messages.

Provides structured data outputs that can be easily consumed by downstream systems.




Integration with Mambo:

The API is consumed by the Mambo project to validate, parse, and extract data from incoming MX or MT messages.

Mambo relies on the API's robust validation and parsing logic to ensure accurate data extraction for further processing and analysis.


Internal Usage in Flex:

Besides being consumed externally by Mambo, Flex also utilizes the API for parsing messages internally.

This internal usage supports additional scenarios where message validation and parsing are required within Flex itself.


Technical Capabilities:

Exposes RESTful endpoints for easy integration.

Supports synchronous and asynchronous processing of messages.

Provides detailed logging and error handling for better traceability and debugging.


Security Features:

Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Ensures secure data transmission with encryption protocols.


Scalability and Performance:

Optimized for high-throughput message processing.

Designed to handle large volumes of financial messages efficiently.
