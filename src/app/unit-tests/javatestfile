Subject: Request for Modification of January CRA – Additional On-Call Day

Dear [Support Team/Diana Support],

I hope you’re doing well.

I would like to request a modification to my CRA for the month of January. Specifically, I need to add one additional day corresponding to an on-call duty (astreinte).

Could you please update my CRA accordingly? Let me know if you need any further details.

Thank you in advance for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
